This is an app that can provide through the OpenWeather API, the realtime weather temperature and some tips for each weather condition.

To use the OpenWeather API you should visit their website and follow the instructions of how to use it in your project, because they maybe chang the api URL or the way to use it.

If you want to clone this project, don't forget to create and repalce the API_KEY value in the weather file that is inside the services folder. You should generate your api_key in the OpenWeather website also.
